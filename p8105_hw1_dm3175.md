Problem 1
=========

The goal of problem 1 is to explore variable types and coercion.

Part 1: Naming Variables and Creation of Data Frame
---------------------------------------------------

The following variables and corresponding interpretation will be considered for Problem 1. For this example, fruit types and condition (Good or Bad) were used:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="21%" />
<col width="78%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Variable Name</th>
<th>Definition</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>uniform_dist</strong></td>
<td>A random sample of size 10 from uniform [0,5] distribution</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>greater_than_two</strong></td>
<td>A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>fruit_type</strong></td>
<td>A length-10 character vector for fruit type</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>fruit_condition</strong></td>
<td>A length-10 factor vector for fruit condition: &quot;Bad&quot; or &quot;Good&quot;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Next, a **data frame** was created containing the variables listed above:

``` r
# Seed is set to ensure reproducibility 
set.seed(1234)

# Create data frame 
problem_1_df = tibble (
  uniform_dist = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5),
  greater_than_two = uniform_dist > 2,
  fruit_type = c("Apple","Orange","Grape","Pear","Kiwi","Banana","Berry","Cherry","Peach","Mango"),
  fruit_condition = factor(c("Good","Bad","Bad","Good","Bad","Good","Good","Good","Good","Bad"))
)
```

Next, an attempt at taking the **mean** of each variable was executed:

``` r
mean(problem_1_df$uniform_dist)
```

    ## [1] 2.446132

``` r
mean(problem_1_df$greater_than_two)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(problem_1_df$fruit_type)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem_1_df$fruit_type): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(problem_1_df$fruit_condition)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem_1_df$fruit_condition): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean can be successfully taken on both the "uniform\_dist" variable because it is numerical and the "greater\_than\_two" variable because it is a logical variable. The logical variable codes "TRUE" responses as 1 and "FALSE" responses as 0, which allows the mean to be interpreted as the proportion of "TRUE" values in the dataset. The mean cannot be taken of "fruit\_type" or "fruit\_condition" because these variables are character and factor variables, respectively, which do not allow for a numeric mean to be computed.

Part 2: Conversion of variables to different types
--------------------------------------------------

Next, the logical, character, and factor variables were converted to numerical variables using the `as.numeric` function.
