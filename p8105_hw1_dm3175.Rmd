# Background

This file contains the solutions to Homework 1 assignment for Data Science I (P8105). The due date for Homework 1 is 9/21/2018.

# Problem 1

The goal of problem 1 is to explore variable types and coercion. 

## Part 1: Naming Variables and Creation of Data Frame

The following variables and corresponding interpretation will be considered for Problem 1: 

Variable Name  |  Definition
---------------|---------------------------------------------------------
**uniform_dist**| A random sample of size 10 from uniform [0,5] distribution
**vec_logical** | A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
**vec_char** | A length-10 character vector
**vec_factor** | A length-10 factor vector


## Part 2: Conversion of variables to different types
